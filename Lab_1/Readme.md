- Download a current copy of the HTML5 boilerplate template from http://html5boilerplate.com/.
- Open the index.html template.
- Using the provided short article (boilerplate.txt) as your content, paste the text into the correct location inside the index.html file, then mark it up with semantic HTML.
- Validate your HTML (http://validator.w3.org/).
- Apply a few simple CSS styles in the boilerplate main.css file to change the appearance of your document â€“ take care to put the CSS styles where they belong according to the boilerplate CSS comments.
- Try adding one of the provided CSS helper classes to your HTML content (for hiding your content for example).
- Attempt using a Web Font service (like Google Fonts) to change the type to look a bit like it came off an old printing press - be sure to add the <link /> element in the correct spot within index.html.
  Try adding some JavaScript (to the correct place in the boilerplate template) to add some simple functionality to the page - it doesn't have to be elaborate.
- View the resulting page on a variety of platforms, browsers, and devices.
- Compress your entire application directory and submit the zip file to the lab in Blackboard or provide a URL to a web server (Github Pages is fine).
