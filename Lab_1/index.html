    <h2>
      Etymology
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Boiler plate" originally referred to the maker's label used to identify the builder of steam boilers.[1]
    </p>
    <p>
      In the field of printing, the term dates back to the early 1900s. From the 1890s onwards, printing plates of text
      for
      widespread reproduction such as advertisements or syndicated columns were cast or stamped in steel (instead of the
      much
      softer and less durable lead alloys used otherwise) ready for the printing press and distributed to newspapers
      around
      the United States. By analogy, they came to be known as 'boilerplates'. One large supplier to newspapers of this
      kind of
      boilerplate was the Western Newspaper Union, which supplied "ready-to-print stories [which] contained national or
      international news" to papers with smaller geographic footprints, which could include advertisements pre-printed
      next to
      the conventional content.[2]

    </p>
    <p>
      Some companies also sent out press releases as boilerplate so that they had to be printed as written. The modern
      equivalent is the press release boilerplate, or "boiler," a paragraph or two that describes the company and its
      products.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Boilerplate Language
    </h2>
    <p>
      In contractual law, the term "boilerplate language" describes the parts of a contract that are considered
      standard.
      <br />Boilerplate language may also exist in pre-created form letters on the Internet for such things as issues to
      be broached
      by a politician based on an issue ad, requests that a cable or satellite operator add a cable network to a system,
      pre-written complaints about a product that is opposed by groups that create such letters, or online petitions.
      The
      person requesting the action usually only needs to type or sign his or her name at the end of the pre-written
      greeting
      and body.

    </p>
    <h2>
      Boilerplate Code
    </h2>
    <p>
      In computer programming, boilerplate is the sections of code that have to be included in many places with little
      or no
      alteration. Such boilerplate is particularly salient when the programmer must include a lot of code for minimal
      functionality. The need for boilerplate can be reduced through high-level mechanisms.
      <br />A related phenomenon, bookkeeping code, is code that is not part of the business logic but is interleaved
      with it in
      order to keep data structures updated or able to handle secondary aspects of the program.
